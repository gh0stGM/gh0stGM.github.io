I"¾<p>Iâ€™ve recently attempted and attained the eCPTXv2 certification which is aimed at experienced penetration testers whom want to specialize in the area of infrastructure security. In this review Iâ€™ll go through the end-to-end process, looking at the course materials, labs and the exam.</p>

<h1 id="course-materials">Course materials</h1>

<p>eCPTXv2 is an updated version of the v1 course with the biggest difference being the inclusion of 3 huge Active Directory labs. It seemed like eLearnSecurity received their share of complaints regarding the lack of these labs in the previous version which prompted them to update the course in May 2020.</p>

<ul>
